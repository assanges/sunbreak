# Sunbreak Hunting Attributes Calculator

Sunbreak Hunting Attributes Calculator (SHAC) is a calculator for optimising hunting based on the weakeness of the targeted mounsters.

SHAC uses nuxt 3 framework, check out the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

The data figures SHAC used are derived from Shawn's collation, available at [gamer.com.tw](https://forum.gamer.com.tw/C.php?bsn=5786&snA=165373) (ShawnW1031) and [PTT](https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/MH/M.1657188036.A.A28.html) (GaARo). A big hand to him for his hard work and original data from [gamewith.jp](https://gamewith.jp/mhrize/article/show/312232)!
